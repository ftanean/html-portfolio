<h2>My top 3 movies of all time</h2>

<hr/>

<h3>Get Out</h3>
<p>Thriller, very mind-bending and twisted 10/10.</p>

<h3>Encanto</h3>
<p>A tearjerker, very family oriented animated film. Love the songs!</p>

<h3>Elemental</h3>
<p>Another tearjerker, about family, chasing your own dreams and a crying boyfriend.</p>
